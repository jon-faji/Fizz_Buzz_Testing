 # FizzBuzz Project
 This project is a simple implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem in Python complete with unit tests.
 
 # Files
 
 fizzbuzz.py
 → Contains the fizzbuzz(n) function that returns:
 
 - "FizzBuzz" if n is divisible by both 3 and 5.
 
 - "Fizz" if n is divisible by 3 only.
 
 - "Buzz" if n is divisible by 5 only.
 
 - Otherwise, returns n as a string.
 
 main.py
 → Contains:
 
 - Unit tests to verify the fizzbuzz function behavior using unittest.
 
 - Command-line interface that asks users to input a number and displays the corresponding FizzBuzz result.
 
 # How to Run
 
 1. Run the unit tests:
 
 python main.py
 
 2. After tests input a number for FizzBuzz:
 
 
 Enter a number for FizzBuzz:
 
 - Input an integer and it will print the FizzBuzz result.
 
 - If the input is not a valid integer, it will display:
 
 Please enter a valid integer.
 
 # Example Output
 
 1. Ran 3 tests in 0.001s
 
 2. Enter a number for FizzBuzz: 15
 FizzBuzz
 
 3. Enter a number for FizzBuzz: 4
 
 
 4. Enter a number for FizzBuzz: five
 Please enter a valid integer.
